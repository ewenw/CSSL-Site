    bio              : "Stefano Balietti is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Network Science Institute, and a Fellow at the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences (IQSS). His research interests involve: incentives schemes for peer review systems, consensus formation and social influence -- in particular in epistemic communities, equality and efficiency in public-goods games, efficiency in coordination games, philosophy of science -- in particular Paul Feyerabend's body of work. His methodology aims at bringing together agent-based computer simulations and behavioral experiments. He is also an active developer, and he created a JavaScript platform for conducting real-time online behavioral experiments directly in the browser called  [nodeGame](http://www.nodegame.org/)."

    bio              : "Michael's broad research interests lie in the overlap between complex systems and the social sciences. In particular, he is interested in how rational local decisions and interactions can produce unintended and emergent system behavior. Michael has a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics from the University of Vermont, where he did research in computational finance and agent based modeling. Currently, he is working with Chris Riedl to research the effect of different communication networks on a group's ability to solve problems."
