## Job Openings

Two postdoctoral positions in computational social science are available at the Collaborative Social Systems Lab with dual appointments at the Network Science Institute and the D’Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University, to work in the lab of Christoph Riedl. Candidates will be expected to work on a combination of their own research and collaborative projects within the lab. The collaborative projects are wide ranging, including large-scale network datasets (art exhibitions and creative collaborations), and experimental data on groups (crowdsourcing, and collective intelligence). Collaborators include faculty at Northwestern, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Stanford. Visit https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/css-lab to get a sense of recent publications the array of projects. Key conceptual foci will range from understanding social processes on networks, collaboration in groups and organizations, social influence, and collective intelligence.

Particular priorities for hiring this year are: (1) experience in (social scientific– especially online) experimental research; (2) demonstrated capability to work with large network data.

A wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds will be considered (current/past disciplines represented in the lab include computational social science, computer science, economics, applied math, and cognitive psychology) but ability to handle and analyze large data sets, creative thinking, and an interest in working collaboratively across disciplines is a must. Compensation will be competitive.

If you are interested, please send a cover letter, CV, and two letters of reference to: c.riedl@neu.edu by March 15 (sooner is better). Please label e-mails with POSTDOC 2018.
