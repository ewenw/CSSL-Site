## About Us

The Collaborative Social Systems Lab, directed by Christoph Riedl, explores collaboration in distributed environments: how can individuals solve challenging global tasks in social networks from only local, distributed interactions? We use agent-based modeling, conduct lab and field experiments, and analyze large datasets to study how networked interactions influences human behavior, strategies, and success.
