**Christoph Riedl** is the Joseph G. Riesman Research assistant professor for Information Systems at the [D'Amore-McKim School of Business](http://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/). He hold a joint appointment with the [College of Computer & Information Science](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/) and is a core faculty at the [Network Science Institute](http://www.northeastern.edu/networkscience/). He is a fellow at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/) (IQSS) at [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/). 

His research interests are in business analytics, data science, and computational social science which he applies to substantive research questions on [group-decision making](https://christophriedl.net/papers-and-projects/team-formation/), [network science](https://christophriedl.net/papers-and-projects/social-networks/), and [social media](https://christophriedl.net/papers-and-projects/movie-ratings/ "Movie Ratings"). He applies and develops novel computational approaches and machine learning to analyze (experimental) field data in order to study the design of contests, crowd sourcing, and collective intelligence mechanisms. For example, he investigates various aspects of [team formation](https://christophriedl.net/papers-and-projects/team-formation/ "Team Formation") and team work in competitions for creative workers.

Christoph Riedl teaches courses on Business Analytics, Applied Machine Learning, and Information Systems at [D'Amore-McKim School of Business](http://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/) and the [College of Computer & Information Science](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/) at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/). He is also actively involved in the [Network Science PhD Program](http://www.northeastern.edu/networkscience/).

### About the Lab
----------------------------
The Collaborative Social Systems Lab, directed by Christoph Riedl, explores collaboration in distributed environments: how can individuals solve challenging global tasks in social networks from only local, distributed interactions? We use agent-based modeling, conduct lab and field experiments, and analyze large datasets to study how networked interactions influences human behavior, strategies, and success.
